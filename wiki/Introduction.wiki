=Abstract=
GPGMP provides an implementation of a spatially-resolved stochastic simulation algorithm on general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). This algorithm, designed to solve reaction-diffusion equations on a mesoscopic level, has widespread applications in computational biology, molecular chemistry and social systems research. For our implementation, we use the Gillespie multi-particle method, which is well-suited for GPGPUs. In preliminary tests, we could obtain speed ups of around 1-2 orders of magnitudes as compared to standard implementations on CPUs.

=Reaction-Diffusion Equations=
[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reaction-diffusion_systems Reaction-diffusion equations] are concerned with systems consisting of one or more interacting entities which propagate in space through random processes thus exhibiting classical diffusive motion.
