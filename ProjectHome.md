## About ##
Welcome to GPGMP, an implementation of a spatially-resolved stochastic simulation algorithm on general-purpose graphics processing units. You can find a general introduction [here](Introduction.md). If you just want to try it out without downloading the source, please have a look at our [Inchman tutorial](InchmanTutorial.md) (or jump to [Inchman](http://monash-inchman.appspot.com/) if you know what you are doing). Inchman has very limited capabilities to specify the models and only provides a summary information of the output. For a more flexible application, you may want to [download](http://code.google.com/p/gpgmp/downloads/list) the source code. Please refer to the [usage information](Usage.md) for details.
